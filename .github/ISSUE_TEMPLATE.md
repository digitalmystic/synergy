It's very important that you distinguish which operating system is the client and which
is the server. The server is the computer that the mouse and keyboard are shared from.

### Synergy Version ###

# README & DELETE #

---BEGIN HELP---

If you're not using the latest version of Synergy, please update first:
https://symless.com/synergy/downloads

Please don't rely on Linux package manager versioning, they sometimes get it wrong.
If using the command line, you can use the `--version` arg to get your installed
Synergy version, like so:

Synergy 1: `synergys --version`
Synergy 2: `synergy-core --server --version`

If you're using the Synergy 1 config app (main Synergy app) then go to the Help
menu, and click About. In Synergy 2 Beta, the version is displayed at all times.

### Log URLs ###

# README & DELETE #

---BEGIN HELP---

Please do not paste entire logs here, it looks really silly. Instead, upload your logs,
and share the URLs to the uploaded logs. Here's how you that:

Synergy 1: https://symless.com/help/s1-troubleshooting/s1-sending-logs
Synergy 2: https://symless.com/help/s2-troubleshooting/s2-sending-logs

Make sure you say which log is for which computer, and also which computer is the
client and which one is the server. This helps to avoid any confusion.
